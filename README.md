## Aug 1, 2024:
Researching what the role of image segmentation is and what technolgies are being used such as YOLOv8 and openCV.

Types of image segemantion
- semantic segmentation: focuses on sematic classes (assigns pixels that represent a class)
- instance segmentation: focuses on delineating instances of objects of a similar class
- panoptic segemenation: combination of semantic and instance segmentation

Use Cases:
- Medical Imaging
- Autonomous vehicles
- Satellite imaging
- Smart cities
- Manufacturing
- Agriculture
